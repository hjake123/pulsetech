- Added the 'hide' keyword, which makes certain macros invisible to the Program Emitter
- Fixed a crash when running alongside Alternate Current
- Fixed a hang when using macros that self-recurse excessively
- Added a config value to adjust the number of times macros can unwrap in a single evaluation 
- Allowed all signal emitting blocks to strongly power blocks they are directly facing, similarly to Repeaters
